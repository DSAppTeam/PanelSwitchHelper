#### Support for dynamically changing the height of the input method/hiding the display of the navigation bar
In many IM scenarios on the market, when users change the height of the input method and switch back to the function panel, the height inconsistency occurs, as does WeChat. At the same time, it also needs to adapt to the devices with navigation bar operations, such as Huawei and Xiaomi. In order to pursue a smoother switching effect, the framework supports adapting the function panel when dynamically changing the height of the input method.
